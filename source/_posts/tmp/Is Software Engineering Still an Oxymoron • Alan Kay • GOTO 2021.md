# Is Software Engineering Still an Oxymoron
## 软件工程仍然是矛盾修辞吗？

## Introduction / 引言

Here's how this came about: last year, Fraben contacted me and asked me if I'd do a conference for GOTO's conference last year. Well, I didn't know he gave me a title which is really scary: "Is software engineering still an oxymoron?" Can you answer this in any reasonable way, and it's for people who are in the software engineering business - which really is scary. And he wanted me to do it pretty quickly, so I said yes.

这就是事情的经过，实际上是去年弗拉本联系了我，问我是否愿意去年参加GOTO会议做演讲。我不知道他给了我一个标题，这真的很吓人："软件工程仍然是一个矛盾修辞法吗？"你能以任何合理的方式回答这个问题吗，这是给那些从事软件工程行业的人的，这真的很可怕。他希望我很快完成，所以我说了是的。

Because a keynote is supposed to be contextual, it's not a question of giving you straight information about today's technology. This is an excellent question to put context on a software engineering conference.

因为主题演讲应该是有背景的，这不是给你直接提供今天技术信息的问题。我认为这是一个很好的问题，可以为软件工程会议提供背景。

## Personal Background / 个人背景

I have a one-line bio: "No one owes more to his research community" - which is the ARPA/PARC research community. Most of us in that community feel the same way - it's what we did within that community that counted.

我有一行简介，说没有人比他更感激他的研究社区，那就是ARPA帕克研究社区，我们大多数在那个社区的人都有同样的感觉，重要的是我们在那个社区所做的事情。

My tombstone will be a single word: "curious." I'm basically a systems guy, so computing is part of that, but I've worked in biology, I've worked in human systems - I like systems.

我的墓志铭将是单个词："好奇"，我基本上是一个系统人员，计算是其中的一部分，但我曾在生物学领域工作过，我在人类系统领域工作过，所以我喜欢系统。

## Defining Engineering / 定义工程

To deal with this question, I think we define engineering as: **designing, making, and repairing things in principled ways**. If that's the case, then it's certainly not an oxymoron - that is what most people in software do. They have principles and they design, make, and repair things.

为了处理这个问题，我认为我们将工程定义为：以有原则的方式设计、制造和修理东西。如果是这样的话，那肯定不是矛盾修辞法，这就是大多数软件人员所做的。他们有原则，他们设计、制造和修理东西。

But we have to think about this as part of engineering. We just have to open up this term "engineering" a bit. I think "oxymoron" is kind of insulting, so let's use "aspiration."

所以我们必须将此视为工程的一部分。这意味着我们必须稍微开放一下工程这个术语。我认为矛盾修辞法有点侮辱性，所以让我们用抱负。

## Historical Context of Engineering / 工程的历史背景

Most things start with tinkering - we share tinkering with many mammals. We just do something any old way, we have an aesthetic sense that tells us whether we like something or not, and by iterating that we eventually wind up with principles.

大多数事情都是从摆弄开始的，我们与许多哺乳动物共享摆弄的特性。我们只是用任何老方式做某事，我们有一种美学感，告诉我们是否喜欢某样东西，通过迭代，我们最终会得到原则。

The principles in the old days (and in many cases today) are in the form of cookbooks - many recipes where it's not completely understood why recipes work, but it's known that they do and they're collected together.

在过去和今天的许多情况下，这些原则都是以食谱的形式出现，其中有许多食谱，人们并不完全理解为什么食谱有效，但知道它们确实有效，而且它们被收集在一起。

Then just about 400 years ago, what we call "real science" entered the scene very, very late because it's a very different kind of thing from these other four things. It has to do not just with knowledge but with the fact that what we call knowledge is something we have to deal with in a very noisy and messy brain with noisy representations.

然后大约400年前，我们称之为真正科学的东西非常非常晚地进入了舞台，因为它与这其他四样东西是非常不同的一种东西。它不仅仅与知识有关，而且与这样一个事实有关：我们称之为知识的东西是我们必须在非常嘈杂和混乱的大脑中处理的东西，有嘈杂的表征。

In the 20th century, we had this wonderful thing happen: engineering finally got to embedding enough science in it (very, very late - hundreds of years late) but finally there, and you got this synergistic combination of tinkering, aesthetics, engineering, mathematics, and science.

在20世纪，我们发生了这件美妙的事情：工程最终开始嵌入足够的科学，非常非常晚，几百年后才出现，但终于出现了，你得到了摆弄、美学、工程、数学和科学的协同组合。

## The Five Kinds of Thinking / 五种思维方式

There are five kinds of thinking and knowledge, and each of these is different enough that it tends to attract different kinds of personalities. To get all of these down there are exceptions - some people do - but what is actually done is to try to put together groups of people that combine these personalities.

有五种思维方式和知识，每种都足够不同，所以它倾向于吸引不同类型的个性。要掌握所有这些，有一些例外，有些人能做到，但实际上做的是尝试把结合了这些个性的人组成小组。

When you have that, you have something more powerful than has ever been done on the planet before - that's what gives you something like the Akashi Straits Bridge and the Empire State Building.

当你有了这个，你就有了比地球上以前做过的任何事情都更强大的东西，这就是给你明石海峡大桥和帝国大厦这样的东西的原因。

## Where is Software Engineering Today? / 软件工程今天在哪里？

If we ask the question "Where is software engineering on this map?" I think it's a little bit like this now:
- Still a lot of tinkering
- A little of real engineering
- Tiny bit of math (I don't count programming as math here)
- Just a little bit of science

现在如果我们问软件工程在这个地图上的位置，我认为现在有点像这样：它仍然有很多摆弄，有一点真正的工程，一点点数学（我在这里不把编程算作数学），只有一点点科学。

It's like where engineering/medicine were maybe a hundred years ago. It's evolving into something where it is taking on more of the ancillary knowledge that's needed.

所以它就像工程医学大概一百年前的样子。它正在发展成某种东西，正在承担更多所需的辅助知识。

## Real-World Examples / 真实案例

### Facebook's Outage / Facebook的停机
When I was making up the slide, I needed a good example - and Facebook's day off happened. A very large company with billions of users went off the net for about six hours to the point where they couldn't get in their own offices.

现在我在制作幻灯片时需要一个好的例子，发生了Facebook的休假日，一家拥有数十亿用户的非常非常大的公司关闭网络大约六个小时，以至于他们无法进入自己的办公室。

This has happened to other companies - Amazon, Microsoft - but somehow the internet itself hasn't crashed like this. I know a lot of the people who did the design of the internet, and they were much more comprehensive than most computer people I know today. They did a heck of a job because they didn't just design for success - they designed for failure.

这发生在其他公司身上，亚马逊、微软，但不知怎么的，互联网本身没有像这样崩溃过。我认识很多设计互联网的人，他们比我今天认识的大多数计算机人员更全面。他们做了非常出色的工作，因为他们不仅仅是为了成功而设计，他们是为了失败而设计。

### Boeing 737 MAX / 波音737 MAX
The Boeing 737 MAX autopilot is another example. The autopilot does not know how to fly the plane but is still put in charge of it, and Boeing let this happen not just once but twice. This is a terrible thing - software is starting to kill people.

波音737 MAX自动驾驶仪是另一个例子。自动驾驶仪不知道如何驾驶飞机，但仍然被委以重任，波音让这种情况发生了一次又一次。这是一件可怕的事情，软件开始杀人了。

### Dunning-Kruger Effect / 邓宁-克鲁格效应
This is about the man who robbed a bank after covering his face in lemon juice, believing it would make him invisible to cameras. This is a classic example of the Dunning-Kruger effect, where people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability. This is a huge problem in software, where people often overestimate their abilities and create systems they don't fully understand.

这是关于一个用柠檬汁涂满脸后抢劫银行的人，他相信这会让他对摄像机隐形。这是邓宁-克鲁格效应的经典例子，即在某项任务上能力较低的人会高估自己的能力。这在软件领域是一个巨大的问题，人们常常高估自己的能力，并创建他们不完全理解的系统。

### Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad / 伊凡·苏泽兰的画板
Sketchpad was a revolutionary program created in the early 1960s. It allowed users to create and manipulate drawings directly on a screen with a light pen. It was one of the first programs to use a graphical user interface (GUI), object-oriented programming, and constraint-based drawing. It was a powerful tool that could be used to design everything from bridges to electrical circuits. It's a powerful example of what's possible when we build systems that augment human intellect, rather than just automating tasks.

画板是20世纪60年代初创建的一个革命性程序。它允许用户使用光笔直接在屏幕上创建和操作绘图。它是最早使用图形用户界面（GUI）、面向对象编程和基于约束的绘图的程序之一。它是一个强大的工具，可以用来设计从桥梁到电路的任何东西。这是一个强有力的例子，说明了当我们构建增强人类智力的系统，而不仅仅是自动化任务时，什么是可能的。

## The Engineering Pledge / 工程誓言

The pledge of a real engineer is:
- The bridge must not collapse
- The building must not fall
- The plane must not crash
- **Now: The software must not harm or fail**

真正工程师的誓言是：
- 桥梁不能倒塌
- 建筑物不能倒塌
- 飞机不能坠毁
- **现在：软件不能伤害或失败**

Software has the most degrees of freedom - it's the most dangerous new set of technologies invented. The engineering pledge here has to be even higher quality, much higher than what is being put into it.

软件有最多的自由度，它是最危险的新发明的技术集。这里的工程誓言必须有更高的质量，它必须高得多，比投入到其中的东西。

Real civilization is not a place you get to - it's a group of people striving to become more civilized. Engineering is a process, not a place - it's people striving to become better engineers.

真正的文明不是你到达的地方，它是一群努力变得更文明的人。工程是一个过程，不是一个地方，它是人们努力变得更好工程师。

## Conclusion / 结论

Whatever we are doing each day, we also have to ask ourselves: "Are we also striving to become better engineers?"

无论我们每天在做什么，我们也必须问自己："我们是否也在努力成为更好的工程师？"
