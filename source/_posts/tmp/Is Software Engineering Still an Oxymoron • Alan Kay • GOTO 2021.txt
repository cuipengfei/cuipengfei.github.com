00:04 [Music] 音乐
00:13 here's how this uh came about actually it was last year fraben contacted me and asked me if i'd 这就是事情的经过，实际上是去年弗拉本联系了我，问我是否愿意
00:20 do a conference for gotu's conference last year and 去年参加GOTO会议做演讲
00:25 well i didn't know he gave me a title which is really scary 我不知道他给了我一个标题，这真的很吓人
00:32 is software engineering still an oxymoron can you answer this in any reasonable 软件工程仍然是一个矛盾修辞法吗？你能以任何合理的方式回答这个问题吗
00:37 way and it's for people who are in the software engineering business which 这是给那些从事软件工程行业的人的
00:43 really is scary and he wanted me to do it pretty quickly 这真的很可怕，他希望我很快完成
00:49 so i said yes 所以我说了是的
00:57 because a keynote is supposed to be contextual 因为主题演讲应该是有背景的
01:02 it's not a question of giving you straight information about today's technology 这不是给你直接提供今天技术信息的问题
01:08 and this is a an excellent question i think to put context on a software engineering conference 我认为这是一个很好的问题，可以为软件工程会议提供背景
01:16 and i have a one-line bio which is no one owes more to his research community 我有一行简介，说没有人比他更感激他的研究社区
01:21 which is the arpa park research community most of us in that community feel the same way 那就是ARPA帕克研究社区，我们大多数在那个社区的人都有同样的感觉
01:27 it's what we did within that community that counted 重要的是我们在那个社区所做的事情
01:34 my tombstone will be a single word 我的墓志铭将是单个词
01:40 curious and i'm basically a systems guy so 好奇，我基本上是一个系统人员
01:46 computing is part of that but i uh have worked in biology 计算是其中的一部分，但我曾在生物学领域工作过
01:51 i worked in human systems so i like systems 我在人类系统领域工作过，所以我喜欢系统
01:58 and this talk uh is a complicated one because of the 这次演讲很复杂，因为
02:06 two other talks on software engineering in between i gave 在这期间我做了两次关于软件工程的其他演讲
02:12 were well received but i didn't feel like i covered the ground 得到了很好的反响，但我觉得我没有充分覆盖这些内容
02:17 well enough so for this one i engaged a bunch of my friends and colleagues 足够好，所以对于这次演讲，我邀请了我的一些朋友和同事
02:24 who've had a lot of experience in various aspects of software 那些在软件工程各个方面都有丰富经验的人
02:31 engineering for instance gerald holtzman was responsible for the three and a half 比如杰拉尔德·霍尔茨曼负责了三十五
02:37 million lines of amazingly workable c code that 百万行令人惊叹的可行C代码
02:42 went into the mars curiosity rover a few years ago so 几年前被用于火星好奇号探测器
02:47 this is a basically an assisted talk 这基本上是一次辅助演讲
02:52 and to deal with this question i think we define engineering as 为了处理这个问题，我认为我们将工程定义为
02:58 designing making and repairing things in principled ways 以有原则的方式设计、制造和修理东西
03:03 and if that's the case then it's certainly not an oxymoron that is what most people in software do 如果是这样的话，那肯定不是矛盾修辞法，这就是大多数软件人员所做的
03:11 they have principles and they design make and repair things and many of the people in this room and 他们有原则，他们设计、制造和修理东西，房间里的许多人和
03:18 in the field will say hey software engineering is whatever we do that's maybe an overreach 在这个领域的人会说，嘿，软件工程就是我们所做的，这可能有些过度
03:26 so i think engineering is the term we have to look at uh do we mean it like 所以我认为工程是我们必须关注的术语，我们的意思是我们是否像
03:33 the peruvian rope bridges which i absolutely adore like the salute or even the making of 那些我非常喜欢的秘鲁绳桥，就像致敬甚至
03:40 music which is done in a principled way you can think of these as kind of crafts 音乐一样，它是以有原则的方式完成的，你可以认为这些是某种手工艺
03:47 at a high level but i think we also have to include things like the akashi straits 在高层次上，但我也认为我们必须包括像明石海峡
03:54 bridge how big is this bridge well that's the empire state building 桥，这座桥有多大？那是帝国大厦
03:60 so the pylons on this bridge are as high as one of the tallest buildings 所以这座桥的桥塔和最高的建筑物之一一样高
04:06 in the world and the empire state building itself was done 90 在世界上，帝国大厦本身是在90
04:12 years ago and from the demolition of the site to occupancy 年前建成的，从拆除现场到入住
04:18 was built by less than 3 000 people in less than a year 不到3000人在不到一年的时间内建成
04:24 and i don't know today of any software projects of comparable size that have actually been 我不知道今天有任何可比较规模的软件项目实际上
04:29 able to be put together and built by 3 000 people in less than a year 能够由3000人在不到一年的时间内组装和建造
04:34 so we have to think about this as part of engineering 所以我们必须将此视为工程的一部分
04:40 that means uh we just have to open up this term engineering a bit 这意味着我们必须稍微开放一下工程这个术语
04:46 i think oxymoron is kind of insulting so let's use aspiration 我认为矛盾修辞法有点侮辱性，所以让我们用抱负
04:52 and i'm always interested in the soft and software because there's nothing less soft than a 我总是对软和软件感兴趣，因为没有什么比
04:58 legacy system it just doesn't want to be changed 更不软的东西了，遗留系统就是不想被改变
05:03 and there's nothing more soft than a buggy system so these are kind of a 而且没有什么比有缺陷的系统更软了，所以这些是一种
05:10 way of thinking backwards if you will so i 如果可以这么说的话，这是一种逆向思考方式，所以
05:15 propose this as the actual title of this talk 我提议这作为这次演讲的实际标题
05:20 and we want to aspire we want to learn 我们想要有抱负，我们想要学习
05:26 we have to understand what engineering is and we need to understand the hardness and the softness 我们必须理解什么是工程，我们需要理解硬度和软度
05:32 and i'll mainly talk about the the last two 所以我主要谈论最后两个
05:40 so if we go back before the wear bridges we can see the historical development of all of these fields 所以如果我们回到磨损桥梁之前，我们可以看到所有这些领域的历史发展
05:47 because most things start with tinkering and we share tinkering with many mammals so we just do something any old way 因为大多数事情都是从摆弄开始的，我们与许多哺乳动物共享摆弄的特性，所以我们只是用任何老方式做某事
05:55 we have an aesthetic sense that tells us whether we like 我们有一种美学感，告诉我们是否喜欢
06:01 something or not and by iterating that we eventually wind up with principles 某样东西，通过迭代，我们最终会得到原则
06:07 the principles in the old days and in many cases today are in the form of cookbooks 在过去和今天的许多情况下，这些原则都是以食谱的形式出现
06:13 where many recipes it's not completely understood why recipes work 其中有许多食谱，人们并不完全理解为什么食谱有效
06:19 but it's known that they do and they're collected together 但知道它们确实有效，而且它们被收集在一起
06:25 mathematics was like that also and it was used to allow a certain kind of thinking 数学也是这样，它被用来允许某种思维方式
06:31 that did not require the building of the structures and these all co-evolved 这种思维方式不需要构建结构，这些都共同进化了
06:38 and then just about 400 years ago what we call real science uh entered the scene very very late 然后大约400年前，我们称之为真正科学的东西非常非常晚地进入了舞台
06:46 because it's a very different kind of thing from these other four things 因为它与这其他四样东西是非常不同的一种东西
06:52 it has to do not just with knowledge but it has to do with the fact 它不仅仅与知识有关，而且与这样一个事实有关
06:58 that what we call knowledge is something we have to deal with in a very noisy and messy brain 我们称之为知识的东西是我们必须在非常嘈杂和混乱的大脑中处理的东西
07:05 with noisy representations and so in order to get real knowledge out of science we 有嘈杂的表征，所以为了从科学中获得真正的知识，我们
07:11 have to think about what the knowledge is in a very different way 必须以一种非常不同的方式思考知识是什么
07:17 and in the 20th century we had this wonderful thing happen which was 在20世纪，我们发生了这件美妙的事情，那就是
07:23 engineering finally got to embedding enough science in it 工程最终开始嵌入足够的科学
07:28 very very late hundreds of years late but finally there and you got this synergistic combination 非常非常晚，几百年后才出现，但终于出现了，你得到了这种协同组合
07:36 of tinkering aesthetics engineering mathematics and science 摆弄、美学、工程、数学和科学的协同组合
07:42 and the result of that was that science and technology could arguably 结果是科学和技术可以说
07:48 uh be put as the greatest art form of the 20th century 成为20世纪最伟大的艺术形式
07:54 most people don't even know that it's art but it is and it's this combination that really makes a difference 大多数人甚至不知道这是艺术，但它是，正是这种组合真正产生了影响
08:00 so there's five kinds of uh thinking and knowledge and each of these is different enough so 所以有五种思维方式和知识，每种都足够不同，所以
08:07 it tends to attract different kinds of personalities 它倾向于吸引不同类型的个性
08:14 to get all of these down there are exceptions some people do but 要掌握所有这些，有一些例外，有些人能做到，但
08:20 what is actually done is to try to put together groups of people uh that combine these personalities 实际上做的是尝试把结合了这些个性的人组成小组
08:27 try to do the social engineering needed to get uh these different personalities to cooperate 尝试进行所需的社会工程，让这些不同的个性合作
08:33 when you have that you have something more powerful than has ever been done on the planet before 当你有了这个，你就有了比地球上以前做过的任何事情都更强大的东西
08:41 and that's what gives you something like the akashi streets bridge and the empire state building 这就是给你明石海峡大桥和帝国大厦这样的东西的原因
08:47 now if we ask the question is where is software engineering on this map i think it's a little bit like this now 现在如果我们问软件工程在这个地图上的位置，我认为现在有点像这样
08:54 it's still a lot of tinkering there's a little of real engineering tiny bit of math 它仍然有很多摆弄，有一点真正的工程，一点点数学
09:00 and i don't count programming as math here and just a little bit of science 我在这里不把编程算作数学，只有一点点科学
09:07 so it's like where uh engineering uh medicine 所以它就像工程医学
09:12 uh were uh maybe a hundred years ago or so 大概一百年前的样子
09:17 it's evolving into something where it is taking on more of the ancillary knowledge that's needed 它正在发展成某种东西，正在承担更多所需的辅助知识
09:26 now when i was making up the slide i needed a good example 现在我在制作幻灯片时需要一个好的例子
09:31 and ferris bueller's day off happened i mean facebook's day off 发生了费里斯·布勒的休假日，我是说Facebook的休假日
09:38 and right when i needed it a very very large company with billions 就在我需要的时候，一家拥有数十亿用户的非常非常大的公司
09:46 of users went off the net for about six hours 关闭网络大约六个小时
09:53 to the point where they couldn't get in their own offices 以至于他们无法进入自己的办公室
09:60 and of course this has happened to other companies it's happened to 当然这发生在其他公司身上，发生在
10:05 amazon it's happened to microsoft but 亚马逊身上，发生在微软身上，但是
10:12 yet somehow it has not crashed anything like this 然而不知怎么的，它没有像这样崩溃过任何东西
10:17 uh i know a lot of the people who did the design of the internet and they were 我认识很多设计互联网的人，他们
10:22 much more comprehensive than most of the computer people i know today 他们比我今天认识的大多数计算机人员更全面
10:28 did a heck of a job because they didn't just design for success 做了非常出色的工作，因为他们不仅仅是为了成功而设计
10:33 they designed for failure and in fact the whole way of the arpa community designing 他们是为了失败而设计，实际上ARPA社区设计的整个方式
10:41 both the internet and the ethernet is to deal with failure as the main fact 互联网和以太网都是把处理失败作为主要事实
10:47 and make failure not be a factor in the successful operation 并使失败不在成功运行中成为因素
10:53 well i got one of these guys to comment on the facebook 好吧，我让这些家伙中的一个对Facebook发表评论
10:58 thing and he said well the facebook engineers are far from stupid or ignorant 他说，Facebook的工程师远非愚蠢或无知
11:04 in fact they're the opposite of that but the internal architecture is such that certain very small errors but only a few 实际上他们是相反的，但内部架构是这样的，某些非常小的错误但只有少数
11:11 can have huge mystifying ramifications 可能产生巨大的令人困惑的后果
11:16 he said could there be a internal rule check 他说，是否可以有一个内部规则检查
11:23 that says we shouldn't ever partition the internet on purpose 说我们不应该故意分割互联网
11:28 and what they've got there is uh configuration checking programs but 他们那里有的是配置检查程序，但是
11:35 they don't have even have what my firefox browser has which is when i 他们甚至没有我的Firefox浏览器有的东西，那就是当我
11:40 close off something it says hey you're about to close four tabs you really want to do that 关闭某些东西时，它会说，嘿，你即将关闭四个标签，你真的想这样做
11:46 you can imagine that facebook should have something come up like this should we shut down the routers and get off the 你可以想象Facebook应该有类似的东西出现，我们应该关闭路由器并退出
11:51 internet well they didn't have that 互联网，好吧，他们没有那个
11:56 so what what they got what they did there was something that was a part of the job 所以他们在那里得到的是工作中的一部分
12:04 but i think with not a large sense of what the job actually is 但我认为他们对工作的实际内容没有很大的认识
12:11 for instance any any large thing that deals with 例如，任何处理
12:17 humans needs to have a modern equivalent of asimov's laws of robotics overseeing the 人类的大型事物都需要有现代版的阿西莫夫机器人定律来监督
12:24 entire system there should be something that understands what a good system is to oversee the entire 整个系统，应该有某种东西理解什么是好系统来监督整个
12:30 system they didn't do it they have no model of the system itself 系统，他们没有这样做，他们没有系统本身的模型
12:36 and most uh enterprises don't do this what is the probability that no one at 大多数企业不这样做，在
12:42 facebook understands this zero i'm sure there are people who do understand this Facebook理解这一点的概率是零，我相信有人理解这一点
12:48 what's the probability that facebook can't afford to fix this zero so what we're looking at is something Facebook无力承担修复这一点的概率是零，所以我们看到的是某种东西
12:55 else here's a clue to the attitude they named the street that they're on hacker way 另外，这里有一个关于他们态度的线索，他们把他们所在的街道命名为黑客之路
13:01 hacking is not what you do when you're building big systems 黑客行为不是你在构建大型系统时做的事情
13:07 drug dealers and other arrogance and rebranding the whole thing isn't 吸毒者和其他傲慢，重新包装整个事情并不能
13:12 going to help no matter what you put up there you're still going to get the thumbs down 帮助，无论你在上面放什么，你仍然会得到倒彩
13:21 so the patron saint of all this is a guy by the name of macarthur wheeler 所以所有这些的主保圣人是一个叫麦克阿瑟·惠勒的人
13:28 here he is on the on the left there robbing a bank without a mask or anything else 他在左边那里，抢劫银行时没有戴面具或任何其他东西
13:35 and uh robbed several banks actually and they looked at the cameras and they 实际上抢劫了几家银行，他们查看了摄像头，他们
13:42 got a picture and uh in a day or so they had found him and arrested him in jail 拍到了照片，在一天左右的时间里他们找到了他并把他关进了监狱
13:49 he was incredulous because he said i wore the juice 他难以置信，因为他说我涂了果汁
13:55 and he had doused himself with lemon juice because he had read about invisible ink made out of lemon juice 他用柠檬汁淋湿了自己，因为他读到过用柠檬汁制成的隐形墨水
14:02 really and he thought well if he doused himself within with lemon juice then the cameras 真的，他想，如果他用柠檬汁淋湿自己，那么摄像头
14:08 wouldn't be able to see him and the psychologists that studied this 就无法看到他，研究这一点的心理学家
14:13 case were named dunning and krueger and this is called the dunning-kruger syndrome 案例被命名为邓宁和克鲁格，这被称为邓宁-克鲁格综合征
14:19 and it's here he is a low-ability guy 这里他是一个能力低下的人
14:24 with a high estimated ability but the important thing about the dunning-kruger people is that they 但邓宁-克鲁格综合征的人的重要之处在于他们
14:31 looked much larger than macarthur wheeler and found that pretty 看起来比麦克阿瑟·惠勒大得多，并发现
14:37 much every human being overestimates their ability 每个人都高估了自己的能力
14:43 and you have the basis of greek tragedy and theater up here at this end and you have 希腊悲剧和戏剧的基础就在这里这一端，你有
14:50 superior people who overreach and as the greeks used to say hubris brings nemesis 超越自己能力范围的优秀人士，正如希腊人常说的，傲慢带来报应
14:57 there are also packed little packets of modesty so one of the touring award winners uh 还有一些谦逊的小包裹，所以图灵奖获得者之一
15:04 from my era tony once pointed out debugging is harder than programming so don't use all your 来自我那个时代的托尼·霍尔曾经指出，调试比编程更难，所以不要用光你所有的
15:10 cleverness in writing the program but this is what most people do 聪明才智来编写程序，但这是大多数人做的事情
15:15 they're as clever as they possibly can be before the real work starts 他们在真正的工作开始之前尽可能地聪明
15:22 einstein said a bigger thing we cannot solve our problems with the same levels of thinking that we use to create them 爱因斯坦说，我们无法用创造问题的同样思维水平来解决更大的问题
15:29 great cartoon these smug pilots have lost touch with regular passengers like us who thinks i should fly the plane 很棒的漫画，这些自满的飞行员失去了与我们这样的普通乘客的联系，谁认为我应该驾驶飞机
15:38 here's zuckerberg who thinks i should run the company 这是扎克伯格，他认为我应该经营公司
15:44 not because of the crash but because they didn't have enough knowledge and perspective to understand they were creating a legal drug 不是因为坠机，而是因为他们没有足够的知识和视角来理解他们正在创造一种合法毒品
15:50 and the worst thing is they were really happy when they realized that they had created a regal legal drug 最糟糕的是，当他们意识到自己创造了一种皇家合法毒品时，他们真的很高兴
15:58 and we just had this guy in the u.s for four terrible years 我们刚刚在美国经历了这个家伙四年的可怕时光
16:06 but if you want dunning-kruger take a look at almost all software 但如果你想要邓宁-克鲁格综合征，看看几乎所有的软件
16:12 not just the facebook software but this is the boeing 737 max autopilot 不仅仅是Facebook软件，这是波音737 MAX自动驾驶仪
16:19 who also asks who thinks i should fly the plane 谁也问谁认为我应该驾驶飞机
16:26 to do is but now this is no longer funny it's no longer a joke because everybody here is going to die 做就是了，但现在这不再好笑了，不再是笑话，因为这里的每个人都会死
16:32 because the boeing 737 max autopilot does not know how to fly the plane but 因为波音737 MAX自动驾驶仪不知道如何驾驶飞机，但是
16:38 is still put in charge of it and boeing let this happen not just once but twice 仍然被委以重任，波音让这种情况发生了一次又一次
16:46 so this is a terrible thing it is worthwhile studying to understand both some of the states that engineering can 所以这是一件可怕的事情，值得研究以理解工程可能处于的一些状态
16:53 get into and some of the states that management can get into 和管理可能陷入的一些状态
17:00 there are many articles about this many forms of lying 现在有很多关于这个的文章，很多形式的谎言，我现在在空军服役，所以
17:07 now i was in the air force so i of course was interested in looking into this more deeply 我当然有兴趣更深入地了解这一点
17:14 and i found this picture of the electronics bay on the 我找到了737 MAX上的电子舱的这张照片
17:21 737 max now i can tell you having been in the air force my reaction was what 737 MAX，现在我可以告诉你，作为一名空军人员，我的反应是
17:28 this is the electronics bay it looks like a trash heap 这是电子舱，看起来像垃圾堆
17:35 and sure enough a few months ago boeing notified airlines that there's a potential electrical problem 正如预期的那样，几个月前波音通知航空公司存在潜在的电气问题
17:41 because some of the things that were in 因为一些在
17:47 this trashy were not sufficiently fastened and it was up to the airlines to find them 这个垃圾中的东西没有被充分固定，航空公司必须找到它们
17:55 so this is an example of artificial stupidity meets human stupidity in greek 所以这是人工智能愚蠢遇见人类愚蠢的希腊例子
18:01 this is happening more and more and software is getting more and more involved 这种情况越来越多，软件越来越深入其中
18:09 but basically we're at a campfire right now 但基本上我们现在就在篝火旁
18:15 talking about are things that were invented because writing 我们谈论的是因为写作而发明的东西
18:20 and mathematics and science got invented and yet we're talking about them orally 而数学和科学被发明了，然而我们正在口头谈论它们
18:25 around a campfire for just a few minutes whereas everything that's important is 在篝火旁只谈几分钟，而所有重要的东西都是
18:32 something that is hard to talk about orally and it can't be done in a couple of minutes 很难口头谈论的东西，而且不能在几分钟内完成
18:39 but somebody who understands this is our cave guy from 100 000 years ago 但理解这一点的人是我们十万年前的穴居人
18:45 he understands completely what's going on here and what he wants is a story 他完全理解这里发生了什么，他想要的是一个故事
18:51 i'm driving i'm trying to make a story 我在开车，我在努力编一个故事
18:56 and that pink brain he has hasn't changed much so if we give him glasses a tie a 而且他那个粉红色的大脑没有改变太多，所以如果我们给他眼镜、领带
19:02 briefcase and bring him up to the presence 一个公文包，把他带到面前
19:08 he still wants a story 他仍然想要一个故事
19:16 and systems have no start and no finish they're a bunch of processes uh interlinked with each other 但系统没有开始和结束，它们是一堆相互连接的过程
19:23 but he still wants a story so one way to look at is human genetics has changed very little over the last 但他仍然想要一个故事，所以一种看法是人类基因在过去
19:29 hundred thousand years as far as we can tell there was a place where our invention 十万年里几乎没有改变，据我们所知，有一个地方我们的发明
19:35 started outpacing what our genetics give us directly 开始超越我们的基因直接给我们的东西
19:40 our culture gather these together and we start increasing our wisdom from what 我们的文化把这些聚集在一起，我们开始从
19:46 human genetics gives us but it's so much easier to invent 人类基因给我们的东西中增加我们的智慧，但发明
19:51 than it is to get wise that we have this complete mismatch today 要比变得聪明容易得多，所以我们今天有了这种完全的不匹配
19:58 this guy with a hundred thousand year old brain a million times the power of his fee 一个拥有十万年历史大脑的人，拥有比他
20:04 of his spear and we give them a million times the power of the campfire to organize people 矛尖强大一百万倍的力量，我们给他们一百万倍篝火的力量来组织人们
20:10 so this is incredibly dangerous and we have hundreds 所以这是极其危险的，我们有数百
20:16 of flaws not just these that i'm showing 个缺陷，不仅仅是这些我展示的
20:23 is very well understood very noticeable 是非常容易理解的，非常明显
20:28 like the covid pandemic was completely botched in most places most citizens in most governments 就像新冠疫情在大多数地方都被完全搞砸了，大多数政府中的大多数公民
20:35 couldn't handle it even though there was nothing new about it 无法处理它，尽管这没有什么新意
20:40 as far as contagion and mortality so that is a very bad sign because 就传染和死亡率而言，所以这是一个非常糟糕的迹象，因为
20:48 in the background here we have something that is much more complex much more devastating which is 在这里我们有某种更复杂、更具破坏性的东西，那就是
20:53 climate problem and right now the general human race is not 气候问题，而现在人类总体上没有
20:59 in any good shape to have any perspective on it 做好任何应对的准备
21:06 so 60 years ago one of the great people in our field 60年前，我们领域的一位伟人
21:12 an engineer's engineer by the name of doug engelbart decided 一位名叫道格·恩格尔巴特的工程师中的工程师决定
21:19 that we have to augment human intellect we have to build things around the human 我们必须增强人类智力，我们必须围绕人类建造东西
21:25 in the general human intellect in order to be able to take care of 在一般的人类智力中，为了能够处理
21:33 all the problems we've had especially the problems we've caused 所有问题，特别是我们造成的问题
21:40 it's really important to understand he basically says this explores the nature of the system 这很重要，他基本上说这探索了系统的本质
21:47 composed of the individual and the tools concepts and methods that match his basic capabilities to his problems 由个人和工具、概念和方法组成的系统，这些工具、概念和方法将他的基本能力与他的问题相匹配
21:54 that's just what we need he says in 1962 one of the tools that 正是我们需要的，他在1962年说，工具之一
21:59 shows the greatest immediate promise is the computer when it can be harnessed for direct online assistance 显示出最大即时前景的是计算机，当它能够用于直接在线协助时
22:06 integrated with new concepts and methods 所以这还没有真正发生
22:11 so this hadn't really happened yet 但可以看出它即将发生
22:17 but he could see that it was going to and one of the things he describes in here 但他可以看出它即将发生，他在其中描述的一件事
22:23 which he saw an early version of is a 他看到了早期版本的是一个
22:29 kind of a thinker of the future's augmentation system that includes this 未来增强系统的思考者，其中包括这个
22:35 very large three f meter by meter display pointing device 非常大的三英尺乘一米的显示指向设备
22:41 a system in which you can give advice to semi-intelligent and so forth so that 一个你可以给半智能体等建议的系统，这样
22:47 was the image in the early pages of this and he realized 这是早期页面中的图像，他意识到
22:53 when we have a pink brain and we're given power what we learn from the power is power 当我们有一个粉红色的大脑并被赋予力量时，我们从力量中学到的是力量
23:00 we don't learn wisdom from it and this gives us a rather wrong view a dangerous view of 我们没有从中学习智慧，这给了我们一个相当错误的观点，一个危险的观点
23:08 how to use power 所以他首先呼吁的是，我们必须用教育和培训来中介
23:14 with education and training in order to get a more reasonable balance between wisdom 为了在智慧和力量之间取得更合理的平衡
23:22 and power if we do that then we can use modern methods which are extremely powerful and 如果我们这样做，那么我们可以使用极其强大的现代方法
23:28 modern ways of representing ideas especially on computers and we get this 现代表示思想的方式，特别是在计算机上，我们得到这个
23:34 quintuple which is an augmented human 五重组合，这是一个增强的人类
23:40 people do that make a difference in the world are done with groups 然后他说，人们做那些在世界上产生影响的事情都是通过团队完成的
23:46 and so what we want to do is we want to make up groups of these augmented humans 所以我们要做的是组成这些增强人类的团队
23:52 groups also so it's something like that and then just four years after making 这些团队也必须是增强的团队，所以是这样的，然后在提出
23:58 this proposal they gave what is known as the mother of all demos 这个提议仅仅四年后，他们进行了被称为所有演示之母的演示
24:04 in which they showed many aspects of modern personal 在其中他们展示了现代个人
24:09 computing and networking today an important thing to understand here is that these were not the 计算和网络的许多方面，今天这里要理解的重要一点是，这些不是
24:14 precursors of many things we do today for example 我们今天做的许多事情的前身，例如
24:20 uh this looks the top pain there with the guy talking and 这看起来像是顶部的疼痛，那里有一个人在说话和
24:25 showing looks like what i'm doing but in fact in the englebarts system 显示看起来像我在做的事情，但实际上在恩格尔巴特系统中
24:31 every participant had his own cursor every participant 每个参与者都有自己的光标，每个参与者
24:36 could deal with the information simultaneously and that was built into the operating system 都可以同时处理信息，这被内置到操作系统中
24:42 there's no such thing today today is actually a subset 没有这样的东西，今天实际上是
24:48 of many of the things shown in this demo in full glory 和他们的系统非常有用和重要，即使当他们面对面开会时，如你所见在底部
24:55 and their system was so useful and so important that even when they had face-to-face meetings as you can see in the bottom 他们的系统非常有用和重要，即使当他们面对面开会时，如你所见在底部
25:00 they did them using the system as part of the representation of their ideas and their communication 他们使用系统作为他们想法和交流的表达的一部分
25:09 so this was one of the great landmark groups and if we again go back to 60 years ago to 所以这是伟大的里程碑团队之一，如果我们再次回到60年前
25:16 one of the inspirations for englebart we find a supercomputer back then which 恩格尔巴特的一个灵感，我们发现当时的超级计算机
25:24 is about the size of a football field part of the air defense system 大约是一个足球场的大小，是防空系统的一部分
25:29 it had uh all of 150 000 instructions per second and all of 330 kilobytes 它每秒有15万条指令和330千字节
25:37 of memory but it was this enormous thing but it was这个巨大的东西
25:46 at three o'clock in the morning is just one guy a graduate student at mit that 在凌晨三点钟只是一个人，麻省理工学院的一名研究生
25:51 they like they gave this machine to him for three hours every morning 他们喜欢，他们每天早上给他这台机器三个小时
25:57 they had an oscilloscope display and a light pin on there 他们有一个示波器显示器和一个光笔
26:05 and here's what he did so the display could only plot points and here's what he did所以显示只能绘制点，这是他做的
26:11 make it be able to draw lines uh do characters and everything else like that 让它能够画线，做字符和其他类似的东西
26:17 so these rubber band lines were his invention and look what he's doing here 所以这些橡皮筋线是他的发明，看看他在这里做什么
26:24 mutually perpendicular and the system itself solved that problem 相互垂直，系统本身解决了这个问题
26:30 so you program this system by giving it desired goals 所以你通过给它期望的目标来编程这个系统
26:35 and it will figure out how to do these goals and it will figure out how to do these goals 它会找出如何实现这些目标
26:42 so that he says make these guys uh parallel 所以他说让这些人平行
26:47 and mutually perpendicular and then he says i want these gu lines to be 相互垂直，然后他说我希望这些引导线是
26:53 collinear with the guidelines i just put in 与我刚刚放入的指南线共线
27:06 now he makes the guidelines transparent and notice that this is the first 现在他让指南线透明，注意这是第一个
27:12 clipping window ever done is actually drawing on it on a canvas 裁剪窗口曾经完成的是实际上在画布上绘制
27:17 about a third of a mile on its side 大约三分之一英里的一边
27:25 now he wants a rivet to put into the 现在他想要一个铆钉放入
27:30 flange there the reason it's called sketch pad is because of the constraint solving 那里的法兰，之所以叫草图板是因为约束求解
27:37 you can just make a rough sketch and then again he does this thing of 你可以只做一个粗略的草图，然后他又做了这件事
27:43 saying make these guys mutually perpendicular this will drag the center guy and that will drag the 说让这些人相互垂直，这会拖动中间的人，那会拖动
27:50 top of the rivet and it generally finds the closest solution to the sketch that you made 铆钉的顶部，它通常会找到最接近你制作的草图的解决方案
27:58 so here he's doing modifying the sketch 所以他在这里修改草图
28:04 and the solution is a different one that obeys the symmetries that he put in 解决方案是不同的，它遵守他放入的对称性
28:10 there but he wants something that looks like a rivet so goes back to this 但他想要看起来像铆钉的东西，所以回到这个
28:18 now here's another idea done for the first time here is that this thing that he did is actually 现在这里是另一个首次完成的想法，这是他做的事情实际上是
28:23 a master rivet what we call a class in object-oriented programming 这是一个主铆钉，我们在面向对象编程中称之为类
28:29 this is one of the very first systems to ever have objects 所以这里是一个实例化的铆钉
28:36 again the rotations and the zooming are being done by knobs that he has 所以旋转和缩放是由他拥有的旋钮完成的
28:43 efficient even compared to ones today 所以现在他把它放进去，他可以制作更多铆钉的实例
28:48 he's got that in there and he's showing us he can make more instances of the rivet 他把它放进去，向我们展示他可以制作更多铆钉的实例
28:54 they're all independent different sizes he says whoops i forgot i've got those 它们都是独立的不同尺寸，他说哎呀我忘了我有那些
29:00 cross pieces i should make those transparent in the master 十字件，我应该让主件中的那些透明
29:07 and we can see all the rivets feel that change 我们可以看到所有铆钉都感受到这种变化
29:14 now he's got a flange with a rivet in it and he says okay i want to make that a master 现在他有一个带铆钉的法兰，他说好的，我想把它做成主件
29:25 i want to make instances of those 我想制作那些的实例
29:34 okay now i want to make that into a master 好的，现在我想把它做成主件
29:42 make instances of those 制作那些的实例
29:49 by the way for each dot that the oscilloscope is plotting there is a code word in the memory of this machine so 顺便说一下，对于示波器绘制的每个点，在这台机器的内存中都有一个代码字
29:56 about half of the computer is actually used just to do the simulated graphic display 大约一半的计算机实际上只用于执行模拟图形显示
30:02 okay now let's take a look at the bridge example this is a recreation of it from 好的，现在让我们看看桥梁的例子，这是根据
30:09 his thesis because the movie has gotten mislaid 他的论文重新制作的，因为电影已经弄丢了
30:15 of it but there's enough information in the thesis that this is pretty faithful 但它，但论文中有足够的信息，这相当忠实
30:23 so again you like making the flans you hook the thing together but now you can turn on a 所以再次你喜欢制作法兰，你把东西连接在一起，但现在你可以打开
30:30 downward force which you can think of as a constraint that tries to make the difference 向下的力，你可以认为这是一种约束，试图使差异
30:37 between everything and the bottom smaller and the constraint on the beams here is 一切和底部之间的差异更小，这里对梁的约束是
30:45 a spring constraint and if you think about it a spring is a thing that tries to maintain a constant 弹簧约束，如果你考虑一下，弹簧是一种试图保持恒定的东西
30:51 length and the constraint solver here 长度，这里的约束求解器
30:57 shows the non-linearity which is what you want to achieve in a bridge 显示了非线性，这是你在桥梁中想要实现的
31:04 everything ripples across everything is connected together 一切都在波动，一切连接在一起
31:09 and the solution here shows that the bridge will handle these weights 解决方案在这里显示桥梁将能够承受这些重量
31:14 so when i first saw this i saw this uh in 66 所以当我第一次看到这个时，我在66年看到了这个
31:21 about four years after ivan had done it i was completely blown away 大约在伊万完成它四年之后，我完全被震撼了
31:26 it changed my life uh this way of thinking about all systems 它改变了我的生活，这种思考所有系统的方式
31:34 the important thing here is that sketchpad didn't have to be prepared with any knowledge of bridges 这里重要的是，草图板不必准备任何关于桥梁的知识
31:40 it could do electric circuits without being prepared with any knowledge of electricity 它可以在没有任何电学知识准备的情况下做电路
31:47 thinking about making systems that propagate things between their parts 关于制作在部件之间传播事物的系统
31:53 and a mind-blowing thought i had was wow this is the first 一个令人震撼的想法是，哇，这是第一个
31:59 thing i've seen on a computer that is programming where the programming is not like the 我在计算机上看到的编程，其中编程不像
32:04 machine code of the computer like algol programming is like 计算机的机器代码，像Algol编程一样
32:09 in when you when i say algol think c today 当我说Algol时，想想今天的C语言
32:16 version of assembly coat most programming done today is like that 机器代码的一个稍微美化版本，今天大多数编程都是这样的
32:21 but what sketchpad did was to completely replace the notion of a von neumann computer 但草图板所做的是完全取代冯·诺依曼计算机的概念
32:27 with a computer that is a goal seeker 用一个目标寻求者的计算机
32:34 and a little operating system that figured out which problem solvers to use all integrated together 三个不同的问题求解器和一个小操作系统，它找出使用哪些问题求解器，所有这些都集成在一起
32:42 so here he is and 所以他是这样的
32:47 so interactive computer graphics and computer aided design clipping windowing pointing iconic user interface 所以交互式计算机图形和计算机辅助设计，裁剪，窗口化，指向，图标用户界面
32:55 object-oriented uh design with masters and instances many interesting internal 面向对象的设计，有主件和实例，许多有趣的内部
33:01 things like the inverted pointer recursive garbage collection idea 像倒置指针递归垃圾收集的想法
33:07 automatic dynamics simulations from the designs and this 从设计中自动动力学模拟，这个
33:12 programming in terms of what's rather than house 所以我的想法是，从这个开始
33:18 and the automatic problem solvers find the solutions and give you this bottom 1966年是，哇，所有交互式计算都可以像这样
33:26 in 1966 is wow all interactive computing could be like this i mean this is kind of like the way it 所以我问伊万，我想是第二年
33:33 all should be it all should be like this for everything 或者这样，我说你怎么能在一年内独自完成所有这些
33:39 or so i said how could you do all of this in just one year all by yourself and machine goat 以及机器代码
33:47 and he said well i didn't know it was hard 他说，嗯，我不知道这很难
33:54 so that is where uh the main cad that we have today started was at 所以这就是我们今天拥有的主要CAD开始的地方
34:00 lincoln labs with this system today an electrical cad 林肯实验室用这个系统，今天一个电气CAD
34:06 chips are not made before they're known that they're going to work because 芯片在知道它们会工作之前不会被制造出来，因为
34:11 it's not just designing something it's simulating it using a supercomputer if necessary 这不仅仅是设计某物，而是必要时使用超级计算机进行模拟
34:17 you know the thing is going to work to know one part in 你知道这个东西会工作，知道其中一部分
34:23 100 million or something like that before you ever do the fad 在你做潮流之前，百万分之一或类似的东西
34:28 recently people at stanford were able to model 最近斯坦福的人们能够建模
34:34 turbulence at close to the atomic level and got a lot more insights into why 最近在接近原子水平上模拟湍流，并对为什么有了更多的见解
34:41 when you can see this the nacelle on this engine is trying to make the wings stall 当你能看到这个时，这个发动机上的整流罩正试图使机翼失速
34:48 above it don't build a building without being able to simulate it 在它上面，不要在无法模拟的情况下建造建筑物
34:54 biocad simulates nanocad simulates 生物CAD模拟，纳米CAD模拟
34:60 we've come over to computers we've got this what simulated punch cards 我们转向了计算机，我们有了这个模拟穿孔卡片
35:07 what is going on here what happened to ivan sutherland and 这里发生了什么，伊万·萨瑟兰发生了什么
35:13 sketchpad what happened to engelbart what happened to integrating science and 草图板，恩格尔巴特发生了什么，将科学和
35:20 math into engineering in most places in the country today 数学融入工程在今天全国大多数地方
35:27 in the world today none of this has happened and this is 在今天的世界，这些都没有发生，这是
35:32 particularly unusual because now we know why because software people 特别不寻常，因为现在我们知道为什么，因为软件人员
35:39 think they should be doing fab much more than designing and simulating 认为他们应该做制造比设计和模拟更多
35:46 the rest of the engineering disciplines know they need uh cad and sim 其他工程学科知道他们需要CAD和模拟
35:53 so they get software people to make better systems for them than the software people have themselves for the 所以他们让软件人员为他们制作比软件人员自己使用的更好的系统
35:59 most part this is crazy but it's actually what's going on 大部分来说这很疯狂，但这就是正在发生的事情
36:05 so mantra here is look it's cad sim fab design simulate built 所以这里的咒语是，看，它是CAD模拟制造设计模拟建造
36:11 you've got to deal with the entire system these days in order to make progress 你这些天必须处理整个系统才能取得进展
36:18 i'm basically a researcher but i've spent the last four decades also 我基本上是一个研究人员，但我也花了过去四十年
36:23 consulting with large organizations that only yielded anecdotes 咨询大型组织，这些只产生了轶事
36:30 and so i engaged these friends and colleagues to give me more anecdotes 所以我请这些朋友和同事给我更多轶事
36:37 so at least have a lot more anecdotes than i have 所以至少比我拥有的轶事多得多

37:13 organization already does those are the most straightforward ones 组织已经做的那些，这些是最直接的
37:19 it gets much more problematic because really most projects these days at least need 它变得更加有问题，因为真的大多数项目这些天至少需要
37:25 things that computing knows that the organization doesn't know 组织不知道的计算知道的东西
37:31 reinvent those and may wind up reinventing the flat tire 重新发明那些东西，可能最终重新发明了瘪胎
37:36 instead of the wheel 而不是轮子

37:48 this one might say hey you should look and see what regu what computing has turned up over the years 这个可能会说，嘿，你应该看看计算多年来发现了什么
37:55 they would find the r1 system that deck used for 如果Facebook这样做了
38:01 modeling complex configurations of its products 他们就会找到Deck用来建模其产品复杂配置的R1系统
38:08 and it was of enough strength to actually prevent the 这个系统足够强大，实际上可以防止

38:46 running i've just talked about the need for complete cat sim fab idea 运行，我刚刚谈到了完整猫模拟制造想法的必要性
38:54 and i just threw this one in because this is a terrific book and i just加了这个因为我这是一本很棒的书
39:00 nancy levison who is a aerospace astronautics engineer at mit 南希·莱维森，她是麻省理工学院的一名航空航天宇航工程师
39:09 and this book is about systems in general and thinking about the whole system 这本书是关于一般系统和思考整个系统
39:16 thinking about what it means to do a safe system first 75 or 100 pages 思考做一个安全系统意味着什么，前75或100页

39:38 and of course with moore's law and requirements getting larger and larger 当然随着摩尔定律和需求越来越大
39:45 a lot of systems require things for success that nobody knows yet 许多系统需要成功所需的东西，没有人知道
39:52 computing knows that it should be doing research funders haven't quite got it 计算知道它应该进行研究，资助者还没有完全理解
39:59 now they used to so i've this is where i've lived my entire career 现在他们曾经这样做过，所以我整个职业生涯都在这里
40:04 and so my knee-jerk response to this kind of thing is something like this we need to invent a live super high level 所以我对这类事情的本能反应是这样的，我们需要发明一个实时的超级高级
40:11 language cad synthetic wobble notes the it's the right advice 语言CAD合成摇摆音符，这是正确的建议
40:19 but it's misplaced it took me a long time to realize that the advice that you would give to 但它放错了地方，我花了很长时间才意识到你会给的建议
40:24 researchers is not the advice that works with most organizations 研究人员的建议并不适用于大多数组织
40:31 and the clue to it is most organizations don't take the trouble to even learn what computing knows 线索是大多数组织甚至不费心去学习计算知道什么
40:37 they tend to stick with what they know and this is very much like the 他们倾向于坚持他们知道的东西，这非常像

41:10 many people go into computing is because they're much less messy than human beings are 许多人进入计算领域是因为他们比人类更不混乱
41:18 but there are people who are trying to understand us but有试图理解我们的人
41:23 by daniel kahneman uh amos taversky was his partner and died 作者是丹尼尔·卡尼曼，阿莫斯·特沃斯基是他的合作伙伴并去世了
41:30 before kahneman wrote this book and the book is dedicated to him 在卡尼曼写这本书之前，这本书献给了他
41:37 ways of thinking about things so first here's a really simple idea 关于事物的思考方式，所以首先这里有一个非常简单的想法
41:42 that inside of our head we've got lots of things going on many many things and they even got a 在我们的头脑里有很多事情在发生，很多很多事情，他们甚至得到了一个
41:49 handle on this they said let's make an apo expository fiction that we'll 处理这个，他们说让我们创造一个修辞性的虚构，我们将
41:55 call system one everything that's done for fast effect 称为系统一，所有为快速效果而做的事情
42:01 and we'll use system two for uh the what we call thinking or slow pondering 我们将使用系统二来处理我们称之为思考或缓慢沉思的东西
42:10 and they had a metaphor that uh inside there it's like 他们有一个比喻，在里面就像
42:15 maybe a person riding on an elephant and when the elephant does something 也许是一个骑在大象上的人，当大象做某事时
42:22 the person to feel and control says i wanted to do that 人感觉和控制说我想做那件事
42:30 and functional mri scans that 以及功能性磁共振扫描
42:35 in many cases it's system one that wants to do something 在许多情况下，是系统一想要做某事
42:41 done and quickly makes up a rationalization for it 完成并迅速为其编造合理化解释
42:47 the term i actually means if inside of our head we're a multitude 术语我实际上意味着如果在我们的头脑里我们是众多的
42:54 and in that multitude we have hundreds of cognitive flaws that distort thinking 而在那个众多中，我们有数百个扭曲思维的认知缺陷
43:00 most of which people are unaware of 所以我只会给你展示几个，因为它们对
43:07 with the task ahead so we take two uh things that whose size we know 前面的任务很有帮助，所以我们取两个我们知道大小的东西
43:15 could be our thumbs it could be oranges could be poker chips 可能是我们的拇指，可能是橙子，可能是扑克筹码
43:20 and look at them have one twice as far away as the other 看看它们，让一个比另一个远两倍
43:27 first thing to think about is you know as far as our brain and our eye is concerned 首先要考虑的是，你知道就我们的大脑和眼睛而言
43:34 there's nothing out there there's nothing out there 外面什么都没有，外面什么都没有
43:40 because all we get is photons photons go through our lens 因为我们得到的只是光子，光子穿过我们的晶状体
43:45 the lens works like a glass lens descartes showed that years ago 晶状体像玻璃透镜一样工作，笛卡尔多年前就证明了这一点
43:52 away one is half the size of the nearer one 远的那个是近的那个的一半大小
43:58 our brain we have the knowledge that these two chips are the same size 在我们的大脑中，我们知道这两个筹码是相同的大小
44:04 so this sets up a conflict between what we know and what we're actually looking at 所以这在我们知道的和我们实际看到的之间产生了冲突
44:10 now you'd think that what we're actually looking at should dominate what we know 现在你会认为我们实际看到的应该支配我们知道的
44:16 what happens is there's a compromise done in this little theater that i'm calling the dream 发生的是在我称之为梦境的这个小剧院里做出了妥协
44:23 it's the thing that we think of as consciousness 这是我们认为的意识
44:29 the further away one is acts as though it's closer than it 远处的那个表现得好像比它更近
44:37 actually is and it winds up being about 80 percent the size 实际上是，它最终大约是80%的大小
44:42 and the dream the way we think about the dream is not 而梦，我们思考梦的方式不是
44:48 inside of our head we think the poker chips are out in front of us 在我们的头脑里，我们认为扑克筹码在我们面前
44:54 and so what we actually see out there is the further away thing about 80 the 所以我们实际在那里看到的是远处的东西大约80%
44:59 size of the of the nearer one even though that isn't actually the case 大小的近处的那个，即使那实际上不是情况
45:05 what one of the things that science is about is to remind us 科学的事情之一是提醒我们
45:11 that we're living in a dream mcluhan said until i believe it i can't 那我们生活在一个梦中，麦克卢汉说，直到我相信它，我不能
45:18 see it that's true that's the way our perception system works 我看不到它，那是真的，那是我们感知系统的工作方式
45:24 everything we see it through modifying our beliefs with sensory information 但我们看到的一切都是通过用感官信息修改我们的信念
45:31 which is also true so we live in a waking dream a delusion 但这也是真的，所以我们生活在一个清醒的梦中，一个错觉
45:37 an hallucination that is only partly influenced by primitive signals that our sense 一个幻觉，只受到我们的感官接收到的原始信号的部分影响
45:42 organs can pick up if we can keep this in mind we can be semi-sane 器官可以接收，如果我们能记住这一点，我们可以半清醒
45:49 and we don't need uh photons from the outside because we can pay attention to our own thoughts 而且我们不需要来自外部的光子，因为我们可以关注自己的想法
45:55 like we can come up with the idea there is no god but my god cost this into the dream 比如我们可以想出这样的想法，没有神，但我的神把这个投入梦境
46:02 and depending on where we are we wind up with a reification of it and again reification seems like it's 根据我们在哪里，我们最终得到它的具体化，再次具体化似乎
46:08 out there instead of inside of us 而是在外面而不是在我们内部
46:14 hundreds of thousands of years there's been no science to remind us that we're in a dream 数十万年来，没有科学提醒我们我们在梦中
46:23 and there are about 3 000 religions because like languages 而且大约有3000种宗教，因为像语言一样
46:30 the manifestations the particular manifestations of these ideas are local 这些想法的体现，这些想法的特定体现是本地的
46:36 but the larger category the category of having gods is global to the human race 但更大的类别，拥有神的类别对人类来说是全球性的
46:46 okay here's a fun one this hunter in africa wants to catch a 好的，这里有一个有趣的，这个非洲的猎人想要抓住一个
46:52 baboon so he's poking a hole in a termite nest 狒狒，所以他在白蚁巢里戳了一个洞
46:57 here and here's a young baboon watching him 这里，这里有一只年轻的狒狒在观察他
47:05 curious the hunter puts some seeds 好奇的猎人放了一些种子
47:12 into this hole and backs off 进入这个洞然后退开
47:22 well he's curious a hunter is a decent distance away so 好吧，他很好奇，猎人离得相当远，所以
47:31 what's in there 里面有什么
47:42 seeds he's got him can't get his hand out because he's got 种子，他抓住了他，无法把手拿出来，因为他有
47:48 the seeds he could let them go any time but he won't let them go 种子，他随时可以放手，但他不会放手
47:55 the hunter could come over and kill him you still won't let him go 猎人可以过来杀了他，你仍然不会让他走
48:06 so the you can find the rest and rest of this video on youtube and i can tell you 所以你可以在youtube上找到这段视频的其余部分，我可以告诉你
48:12 no harm comes to the baboon here 对这只狒狒没有伤害
48:17 the seeds the seeds 种子，种子
48:26 we can make up funny cartoons about not being able to give up terrible old tools 我们可以编造有趣的漫画，关于无法放弃可怕的旧工具
48:33 our field is riddled with things that people can't get rid of because they don't naturally rot 我们的领域充满了人们无法摆脱的东西，因为它们不会自然腐烂
48:40 they just keep on going on and going on 它们只是继续前进和前进
48:46 elevated level of perspective is needed to know that you shouldn't be using these 需要更高层次的视角来知道你不应该使用这些东西
48:53 so if you go to wikipedia don't do it now but you look at cognitive bias 所以如果你去维基百科，现在不要这样做，但你看认知偏差
48:60 in a nice chart like this so we just looked at loss of version 在一个像这样的漂亮图表中，所以我们刚刚看了版本的损失
49:06 there learning aversion is related to it 那里学习厌恶与之相关
49:12 because we usually have to give up something we think is true in order to learn some new thing 因为我们通常必须放弃我们认为是真的东西才能学习一些新东西
49:17 tunnel vision is a big part it's important to understand that all of these cognitive biases in the small are 隧道视野是很大一部分，重要的是要理解所有这些小的认知偏差
49:25 actually positive for us they help us focus on things they help us take chances for instance 实际上对我们是积极的，它们帮助我们专注于事物，它们帮助我们冒险，例如
49:32 gunning krueger in the small is very useful because it makes us less 小规模的邓宁-克鲁格非常有用，因为它让我们不那么
49:37 timid about trying things 对尝试事物胆怯
49:43 huge uh problems 当我们试图扩大这些东西时，它们就变成了巨大的问题
49:50 but when i was a molecular biologist 但当我是一个分子生物学家时
49:55 one of my professors said beware you always find what you're looking for 我的一位教授说小心，你总是找到你在寻找的东西
50:01 this is a big problem in science is you love your own theories so you tend to look for evidence that 这是科学中的一个大问题是，你爱你自己的理论，所以你倾向于寻找证据
50:07 supports the theories rather than evidence that says the theory is bumped 支持理论而不是说理论被撞倒的证据
50:13 most of them are bunk 大多数都是胡说八道
50:20 old cave person stories are the way we tell ourselves 我们十万年前的穴居人故事是我们告诉自己的方式
50:25 lies that really get us in trouble 真正让我们陷入麻烦的谎言
50:31 at this place uh in this talk and this is the way i do 在这个地方，在这个演讲中，这是我做
50:37 talks is i actually make a kind of a whole territory of ideas 演讲的方式，是我实际上创造了一种想法的整个领域
50:44 in this case is like 350 slides every time i get an idea i try 在这种情况下大约是350张幻灯片，每当我有一个想法时，我尝试
50:49 and figure out a way of explaining it after i've got a bunch of them i try 解释它，在我得到一堆想法后，我尝试
50:56 see if i can make a campfire talk because a talk like this in the end it has to 看看我是否能做一个篝火演讲，因为像这样的演讲最终必须
51:02 work in the campfire it has to be turned into a narrative 在篝火中起作用，它必须被转化为一个叙述
51:08 but here's the way to think about this at best the story is an ad or commercial for studying the real thing 但这里是思考这个问题的方法，最好的情况下，故事是研究真实事物的广告或商业宣传
51:15 shown you the real thing i've just shown you that there is a real thing that you can study 我向你展示了真实的东西，我只是向你展示了有一个真实的东西你可以研究
51:21 and the real things today are usually systems and systems have almost nothing to do 真实的东西今天通常是系统，而系统几乎与
51:28 with algorithms and data structures and so if your first way of thinking about anything computing is an algorithm 算法和数据结构无关，所以如果你对任何计算事物的第一种思考方式是算法
51:35 data structures and it is for most people because that's unfortunately the way they're taught exactly backwards 数据结构，对大多数人来说是这样，因为不幸的是，这就是他们被教授的方式，完全颠倒了
51:42 you're starting off in a behind the eight ball 你从一开始就处于劣势
51:48 yeah so while i was doing this i had one of those john lemon linen moments life is what happens to 是的，所以当我在做这件事时，我有了一次约翰·列侬亚麻布时刻，生活就是发生在
51:54 you while you're making plans 你制定计划时的事情
51:59 those scans got me under a bunch of robots for six hours 那些扫描让我在一堆机器人下面待了六个小时
52:05 there i am and when i was recovering in the hospital 那就是我，当我在医院康复时
52:11 from this big operation i had a few weeks ago i had a very happy thought 来自几周前的这次大手术，我有一个非常愉快的想法
52:17 about this talk that is i should have been talking about medicine using it as an analogy 关于这次演讲，也就是说我应该谈论医学，用它作为类比
52:24 because it's hard for people to look at their own field and see anything they're so used to it 因为人们很难看自己的领域并看到任何东西，他们太习惯了
52:30 but a medicine is a branch of engineering but医学是工程的一个分支
52:35 idea from helping hands which is like writing a few lines of python 从帮助手中得到的想法，就像写几行Python代码一样
52:41 to open heart surgery which is not like writing a few lines of python 到心脏直视手术，这不像写几行Python代码
52:49 like here's a surgeon should we ask stack overflow what to do next 比如这里有一个外科医生，我们应该问Stack Overflow下一步该做什么
52:54 happens all the time in computing 所以我们在计算中经常遇到这种情况
52:60 so we go back and try band-aids 所以我们回去尝试创可贴
53:02 so we go back and try band-aids 所以我们回去尝试创可贴
53:09 one of the large mines of the 20th century pointed out that yeah the early pc and mac os were made from matchsticks 20世纪的大矿山之一指出，是的，早期的PC和Mac OS是用火柴棒制作的
53:15 they were kind of tinkered together by people who didn't know about operating systems 他们是由不知道操作系统的人拼凑在一起的
53:22 because vms and unix which are pressed into service were not set up for modern computing 那个修复真的很糟糕，因为被投入使用的服务的VMS和Unix没有为现代计算设置好
53:28 needs and so looking at this you see every kind of 需求，所以看这个，你看到各种各样的
53:33 bug that we should be familiar 你应该熟悉的bug
53:42 you better not have to ask stack overflow about anything important 你最好不要在任何重要的事情上询问Stack Overflow
53:49 you have to have service continue 你必须继续提供服务
53:54 band-aids are not the solution to the most interesting things in medicine 创可贴不是医学中最有趣事物的解决方案
53:60 the way the early pc and mac os's were done don't scale 早期PC和Mac OS的完成方式无法扩展
54:08 and even better ideas don't often scale 而且更好的想法通常也无法扩展
54:14 medicine says there cannot be a continuity between 医学说，在我们领域的创可贴部分和心脏直视手术部分之间不能有连续性
54:20 the band-aid part of our field and the open heart surgery part of our field 我们不能忍受它，我们必须有阶段，我们必须有高围栏
54:27 stand it we have to have stages we have to have high fences 我们不能忍受它，我们必须有阶段，我们必须有高围栏
54:34 we can't allow jumping the queue 我们不能允许插队
54:39 and if we do that we're starting to follow in what 如果我们这样做，我们就开始跟随
54:45 the other engineering fields did and what medicine eventually did about 80 years ago 其他工程领域所做的，以及医学最终在80年前所做的
54:50 which is to integrate science and math and trying things and engineering 这就是将科学和数学以及尝试事物和工程结合起来
54:59 and the whole shebang into one larger discipline that uses knowledge in 将整个事业整合到一个更大的学科中，该学科以
55:05 the best possible ways 所以我很感激我能够等到今天才做手术
55:12 until today rather than having it when i was five years old 而不是在我五岁时做手术
55:18 and medicine has always had a thing called a hippocratic oath and医学一直有一种叫做希波克拉底誓言的东西
55:25 says to the physician the physicians promise to above all do 说对医生，医生承诺最重要的是
55:30 no harm of course they've done a lot of harm but they thought they were doing well 当然他们造成了很多伤害，但他们认为自己做得很好
55:36 but this is a really good one to focus in on because if you really think about 但这是一个非常好的关注点，因为如果你真的思考
55:41 avoiding doing harm you start getting a better picture of 避免造成伤害，你开始更好地了解
55:46 how things might be in our field 所以这里有一座由罗马人建造的桥
55:53 about 2 000 years ago which is still in continuous use today 大约2000年前，至今仍在连续使用
55:59 here's a plane done about 10 years ago not by boeing 这里有一架大约10年前制造的飞机，不是波音制造的
56:05 flying safely and engineering has something like a hippocratic oath also 安全飞行，工程也有类似希波克拉底誓言的东西
56:12 the pledge of a real engineer is the bridge must not collapse the building must not fall the plane must not crash 真正工程师的誓言是桥梁不能倒塌，建筑物不能倒塌，飞机不能坠毁
56:20 and now the software must not harm or fail and software is reaching everywhere 现在软件不能伤害或失败，软件正在到达各个地方
56:26 has the most degrees of freedom it's the most dangerous new 它有最多的自由度，它是最危险的新
56:31 set of technologies invented and it's starting to kill people 发明的技术集，它开始杀人
56:36 so the engineering pledge here has to be even higher quality it has to be much much higher 所以这里的工程誓言必须有更高的质量，它必须高得多
56:43 than what is being put into it and you don't get to a place here so real civilization is not a place you get 比投入到其中的东西，你不能到达一个地方，所以真正的文明不是你到达的地方
56:50 to it's a group of people try striving to become more civilized 它是一群努力变得更文明的人
56:55 a place engineering is a process not a place it's people striving to become better 地方，工程是一个过程，不是一个地方，它是人们努力变得更好
57:01 engineers and i take from that that whatever we are doing each day 工程师，我从中得到的是，无论我们每天在做什么
57:08 we also have to ask ourselves are we also striving to become better engineers 我们也必须问自己，我们是否也在努力成为更好的工程师
57:15 thank you very much and enjoy the rest of your conference [Applause] 非常感谢，享受你们会议的其余时间[掌声]
57:36 you 你
