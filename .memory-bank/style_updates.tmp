### Batch 4 Analysis Findings (New Patterns Only)

**C. Discourse Features (篇章特征):**

*   **C-4. Series Branding/Naming (系列化命名):**
    *   **Observation:** The emergence of the "格物致知" (Gewu Zhizhi - a classical Chinese phrase meaning 'investigating things to acquire knowledge') series for *Effective C#* reading notes.
    *   **Pattern:** An early tendency to "brand" a series of articles on a specific topic with a consistent, culturally rich name. This organizes scattered notes into a coherent series and reflects an early awareness of content branding.

*   **C-5. Short-form, Colloquial Non-Technical Narratives (口语化生活短篇):**
    *   **Observation:** Appearance of short, non-technical posts about daily life, such as being "zapped" (雷) by the school radio or a gatekeeper.
    *   **Pattern:** Use of highly colloquial language and internet slang in titles and content. This marks an expansion of writing from purely technical documentation to include personal, humorous, and emotional expression, representing an early form of the later-established "conversational" and "candid" tone.

**C. Discourse Features (篇章特征):**

*   **C-6. Iterative, Serialized Project Showcase (迭代式项目系列文章):**
    *   **Observation:** A series of posts documenting the creation and subsequent improvements of a personal tool, `Words Via Subtitle`.
    *   **Pattern:** A distinct writing mode focused on showcasing a personal project's evolution. Instead of a single technical explanation, a series of articles tracks the project from inception through multiple iterations (e.g., adding context, document export, video playback). This narrative structure tells a complete 0-to-1-to-N development story, effectively engaging and retaining a long-term reader following. It is a practical application and extension of the "Series Branding/Naming" pattern to personal projects.

### Batch 6 Analysis Findings (New Patterns Only)

**C. Discourse Features (篇章特征):**

*   **C-7. In-depth "Anecdotal Investigation" Analysis (问题探轶式深度分析):**
    *   **Observation:** A shift towards highly structured, investigative articles, such as the deep dives into a "suspected WPF bug" (`Generic.xaml` issue) and the implementation details of C# optional parameters.
    *   **Pattern:** This represents a mature form of "problem-driven" writing. The narrative focuses on the entire **process of discovery, analysis, hypothesis, and resolution**. This "investigative" or "detective-like" storytelling is deeply analytical and showcases the author's identity as a "diagnostician" and "reflector." It shares not just knowledge, but the **methodology of acquiring and validating knowledge**, perfectly aligning with the core pursuit of exploring the "why" behind the "how."

### Batch 7 Analysis Findings (New Patterns Only)

**C. Discourse Features (篇章特征):**

*   **C-8. Didactic Series on "Code Archaeology" and "Classic Recreation" (教学式“代码考古”与“经典重现”系列):**
    *   **Observation:** The "Reimplementing LINQ to Objects" series, which systematically deconstructs and rebuilds a classic library from scratch.
    *   **Pattern:** A new, highly educational series format. Unlike showcasing a personal project, this mode focuses on **"recreating a classic"** to guide readers through the internal workings and design philosophy of an existing, well-known library. This requires the author to have a profound understanding of the subject and the ability to break down complex concepts (like deferred execution, streaming, and API design trade-offs) into digestible parts. This format perfectly embodies the "preacher/evangelist" identity, elevating the core pursuit of "exploring the why" to a new level: not just discussing *why* something was designed a certain way, but *how* one could design it that way from first principles.

**B. Syntactic & Lexical Features (句法与词汇特征):**

*   **B-1. Introduction and Integration of Cross-Disciplinary Ideas (跨领域思想的引入与整合):**
    *   **Observation:** A significant shift in content, with articles dedicated to exploring concepts from economics, history, and sociology (`今日简史`, `小岛经济学`), and reframing technical problems (like `Future/Promise`) as methodological solutions for communication and code organization.
    *   **Pattern:** This marks a new stage where cross-disciplinary knowledge is no longer just a tool for analogy within technical articles but becomes a primary subject of analysis. The author systematically and consciously examines software development issues through the lens of broader intellectual frameworks. This is a deepening of the "connecting cross-domain knowledge" principle, moving from mere **analogy** to direct **integration and introduction**.
